# Quadstruder-K7---Dual-Drive-Extruder
The brass gears are showing signs of wear after only a few months heavy use (see pictures).  I would recommend using the newer version of this design using stainless steel gears. If you use this version, get extra brass gears as they will probably need to be replaced occasionally.
